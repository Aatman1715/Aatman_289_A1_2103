        <img src="../image/profile.jpeg" alt="Your Image">
        <p>Hello, myself Aatman Rajyaguru. I am studying Full Stack Software Development (FSDT) in Lambton College in Toronto, Canada.
            As a person I am very delusional, quick learner. I belong to city called Bhavnagar situated in Gujarat in India.
            My childhood was a golden period which i will cherish forever in my mind. That is time I wish to go back again.
            My hobbies are playing classical musical instruments, reading and dancing. As a child I was very active and playful.
            I am crazy after cars and I have good knowledge about them as well. Talking about my education I have my Bachelors as well 
            as Masters in Computer Applications. I was a very bright student in thr school as well as college time and always involved 
            in activities other than studying as well. 
        </p>
